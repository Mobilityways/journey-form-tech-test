# LiftShare Tech Test

Please provide the app with a Google API key at launch, via a `.env.local` file. It should have the following APIs enabled:

- Geocoding API
- Geolocation API
- Maps JavaScript API

```bash
corepack enable # if you haven't already
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Hope you like it! See email for further comments 😁
